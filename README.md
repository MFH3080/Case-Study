# Case-Study
# OpenAI’s Role in Daily Life

## Overview and Origin
> OpenAI is a nonprofit research company, founded on December 11, 2015, by "Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk serving as the initial board members." [^1] The company launched with the mission "to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return." [^1]. OpenAI’s initial funding came from Microsoft which provided “OpenAI Global LLC with a billion investment in 2019 and a $10 billion investment in 2023”[^14]

## Business Activities

> OpenAI is trying to advance AI with human well-being as its foremost objective and they are doing this by removing financial gain as a motivation. The company is achieving this through its status as a non-profit. The company's intended audience is humanity as a whole as they want to make sure that they can equalize access to artificial intelligence. 
> Due to the company's status as a nonprofit, they are doing research and building for everyone and not just their shareholders, this is a huge advantage over other companies who might be profit-centered and who might center their research and building towards pleasing their stockholders. Another major advantage OpenAI holds is that they "freely collaborate with others across many institutions and expect to Work with companies to research and deploy new technologies."[^1]. This essentially means that they are willing to freely cooperate with other companies to further their progress toward their goal. This also means that other companies and groups can use their technology as long as everything fits under their guidelines so that they can prevent the misuse of the technology.

## Landscape

> OpenAI is in the daily life field of AI as it aims to improve humanity's relation to AI as a whole and is trying to make sure that access to AI is as widely and evenly distributed as possible. Major trends in this field are mainly (but not limited to) chatbots, image generators, and media-curating (recommendations on Netflix, social media feeds, etc.) [^12]. Some other companies in this field are Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, and many others. While some companies are doing similar things to OpenAI, there is a much larger variety of things that are being done.

## Results

> This company is a non-profit so their goal isn't to sell their product but to make it readily available for use by the everyday person, in this vane however, they have been very successful. As hundreds of companies utilize their software and they have 173 million active users as of April 2023 [^4]. OpenAI itself defines success for its ChatGPT-4 through exams, they show statistics for a myriad of different exams. However, they have a couple of exams that they seem to favor over others, displaying the scores on the GPT-4 research page; those exams are the Uniform Bar Exam and the Biology Olympiad. They display that the current ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) scored in the 10th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam while GPT-4 scored in the 90th. We see a similar increase in capability as on the Biology Olympiad ChatGPT scored in the 31st percentile and GPT-4 scored in the 99th. [^9]
> There are not a lot of companies that are doing what OpenAI is trying to do but compared to similar products OpenAI has raised a total of $14B[^3] while companies like Anthropic, Pryon, and InworldAI have raised $3.404B[^3], $158.78M[^10], and $117.12M[^7] respectively. So compared to other companies in the daily life AI field it is doing very well, essentially towering over the “competition”.

## Recommendations

> While their software is used by a lot of different parties, OpenAI is most known for its ChatGPT large language model. Companies with similar models such as Google, Apple, etc. have chosen to implement their software into a home assistant like the Google Home or Alexa, etc. and I believe that it would benefit their goal a lot to take a similar action. Creating their AI-powered smart home assistant would benefit their goal to make sure AI is “as broadly and evenly distributed as possible” [^1], as this is a way to make sure that anyone can get access to an AI assistant within easy access. 
> This product would utilize the technologies that OpenAI already uses for their chat-GPT language model. Additional technologies that would be required would be speech recognition as well as a microphone to listen with. For the assistant to respond it would need to be able to convert its text to speech and output it to a speaker. Additionally, to access any sources outside its memory it would need to be able to wirelessly connect to the internet and be able to collect sources related to the topic. Finally, any number of other technologies could better improve its helpfulness but are completely optional. An example of this would be the option to connect to other devices such as speakers or smart home devices.
